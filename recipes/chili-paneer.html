    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chilli Paneer is a popular Indo-Chinese dish made with cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) that are lightly fried and tossed in a spicy, tangy sauce. The dish typically includes ingredients like garlic, ginger, green chilies, soy sauce, vinegar, and tomato ketchup, along with sautéed onions and capsicum. It has a bold flavor profile—savory, slightly sweet, and moderately spicy.</p>
    <p>It is commonly served as a starter or side dish in restaurants, but it can also be enjoyed with fried rice or noodles as a main course. Chilli Paneer comes in two main variations: dry (with thick coating and minimal gravy) and gravy (with a semi-thick sauce), making it versatile and widely loved across India.</p>
